👋 Hi, I’m @backendmentor, a dedicated back-end developer with experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining robust server-side applications.

👀 I’m interested in collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver efficient and scalable solutions. My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as experience with the Django web framework and database management using PostgreSQL and Redis in Linux.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about RESTful API design and implementation, version control using Git, and other tools such as WordPress, CorelDRAW, and Photoshop.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to continue exploring my passion for information technology and back-end development.
